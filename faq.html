                <h3>What exactly is this service?</h3>
                <p>We're a free connection platform that links Tucson-area homeowners with licensed, vetted AC repair professionals. When you submit a request, we instantly notify 2-3 local technicians who can help. You compare quotes and choose who to hire.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much does this cost?</h3>
                <p>Our service is 100% free for homeowners. You only pay the technician you choose for their actual repair work. We don't charge connection fees, service fees, or commissions.</p>

                <h3>How do you make money?</h3>
                <p>Technicians pay us a small fee to be part of our network. This allows us to offer the service free to homeowners while connecting professionals with customers who need help.</p>

                <h3>How fast will I get a response?</h3>
                <p>Most homeowners hear back within 5-15 minutes during business hours (7 AM - 9 PM). Emergency requests often get even faster responses. Technicians receive instant notifications, so they can call you right away.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How many quotes will I receive?</h3>
                <p>Typically 2-3 from available technicians in your area. This gives you options without overwhelming you with calls.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I don't hear back?</h3>

                <h3>Do I have to pick one of the companies that contacts me?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. You're never obligated to hire anyone. Compare quotes, ask questions, and only proceed if you're comfortable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I get quotes for non-emergency work?</h3>

                <h3>How much will the repair cost?</h3>
                <p>AC repair costs vary widely depending on the problem:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple fixes (thermostat, filter): $75-150</li>
                    <li>Medium repairs (capacitor, contactor): $150-400</li>

            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will I get written quotes?</h3>
                <p>Most technicians provide verbal quotes on-site after diagnosing the issue. Always ask for a written estimate before approving major repairs.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if the price seems too high?</h3>
